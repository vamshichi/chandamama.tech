    title:'OpenAI introduces a new "Canvas" Customized ChatGPT interface for writing and coding tasks',
    image:openAi,
    date:'october 4,2024',
    content:`On Thursday, OpenAI unveiled a brand-new interface for using ChatGPT that it calls "canvas." The software opens a workspace for writing and coding tasks in a separate window that opens next to the standard chat window. Users can write directly on the canvas or use code, then highlight specific areas of their work to have the model make edits. On Thursday, Canvas will go live in beta for ChatGPT Plus and Teams users; Enterprise and Edu users will get it the following week.

A number of consumer AI companies are coming together around editable workspaces as a useful application of generative AI. Similar functionalities are available in ChatGPT's new interface as in Anthropic's Artifacts, which was released in June, and Cursor, the popular coding companion. To expand its paid user base, OpenAI is rushing to match rival services and introduce whole new features in ChatGPT.

Even if AI chatbots nowadays aren't able to do complex tasks with just one instruction, they can frequently provide a useful beginning point. Editable workspaces, such as canvas, let users make corrections to incorrect portions of an AI chatbot's output without requiring them to carefully examine their prompt and write a new section of code.

In a demo with TechCrunch, OpenAI product manager Daniel Levine stated, "This is just a more natural interface for collaborating with ChatGPT."

Levine was required to choose "GPT-4o with canvas" from ChatGPT's model picker drop-down menu during our demonstration. But according to OpenAI, ChatGPT will only display canvas windows when it determines that having a separate workspace could be useful—for example, for lengthy outputs or intricate coding jobs. To open a project window automatically, you may alternatively just write "use canvas."

Levine demonstrated to TechCrunch how the new features of ChatGPT could facilitate email writing. An email generated by ChatGPT can be requested by users, and it will appear in the canvas window. Next, users have the option to change the writing's length by toggling a slider. Additionally, you can highlight particular lines and instruct ChatGPT to add emojis or make changes like "make this sound friendlier." Additionally, users can request that ChatGPT translate the entire email into a different language.

The coding canvas has a few somewhat distinct features. Levine gave ChatGPT instructions to launch a Python API web server, which materialized on the canvas window. ChatGPT allows users to add in-line documentation explaining the code in simple terms by clicking the "add comments" button. Furthermore, you may ask the chatbot to explain anything to you or ask questions about it by highlighting a line of code that ChatGPT produced. Additionally, ChatGPT will gain a new "review code" button that will offer specific revision suggestions for any user-written or automatically generated code in the window for the user to accept, reject, or modify themselves. Should they click "approve," ChatGPT will attempt to resolve the issues on its own.  OpenAI states that it intends to make canvas available to free users as well as it exits beta.`,

      date:'october 4,2024',
      content:`M&M described the response as "unprecedented" and stated that it will gradually notify consumers about the estimated delivery schedules over the course of the following three weeks.
Leading SUV manufacturer Mahindra & Mahindra received 1.76 lakh reservations for its recently released Thar ROXX in less than 60 minutes after the window opened. Delivery will start on October 12, which is Dussehra.

There is discussion over this being the highest first-day booking of any car from the Mahindra Group.

M&M described the response as "unprecedented" and stated that it will gradually notify consumers about the estimated delivery schedules over the course of the following three weeks. The SUV manufacturer stated that reservations for Thar ROXX are still available at all dealerships and on Mahindra's website.
With almost 51,000 SUVs sold in September, M&M reported a 24% YoY increase in SUV sales. At 3,027 units, exports increased by 25% YoY in September as well.

The starting price of the five-door Thar SUV, ROXX, is Rs 12.99 lakh. It comes in both petrol and diesel variants.
The Thar Roxx will be equipped with either a 2.0-litre mStallion turbo petrol engine that provides 160 bhp of maximum power and 330 Nm of torque, or a 2.0-litre mHawk diesel engine that puts out 150 horsepower and 330 Nm. Either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission is attached to each engine.
The Thar ROXX has been built as a mainstream SUV, taking into consideration the wants and requirements of purchasers in the market, rather than as a niche product, according to Rajesh Jejurikar, ED and CEO for the auto and farm company. Even with the three-door model, it has grown to be a significant volume player in its current configuration. Jejurikar has previously stated, "We didn't want to stop at that and we think that we can make this brand bigger."

Initial pricing for the 4x4 versions of the new Thar ROXX from Mahindra & Mahindra ranges from Rs 18.79 lakh to Rs 22.49 lakh (ex-showroom).`,

We think that everyone should have access to resources that support their creativity, regardless of whether they are an aspiring filmmaker seeking to break into Hollywood or a creator who enjoys creating videos for their audience. We are thrilled to present Meta Movie Gen, our ground-breaking generative AI study for media, encompassing picture, video, and audio modalities. Our most recent study shows how to create original films and audio, alter pre-existing videos, and turn your own photo into a personalized video using just basic language inputs. When assessed by humans, Movie Gen performs better on these tasks than comparable models in the market.

This endeavor is a continuation of our extensive and well-established history of disseminating basic AI research to the public. The Make-A-Scene set of models, which allowed for the generation of image, audio, video, and 3D animation, marked the beginning of our first wave of generative AI development. Diffusion models led to a second phase of development with Llama Image foundation models, enabling image modification and higher quality picture and video creation. Our third wave, Movie Gen, combines all of these modalities to provide users of the models even more precise control in a manner that has never been feasible before. As with earlier iterations, we expect these models to facilitate a range of new products that may spur innovation.

These foundation models have a lot of fascinating applications, but it's crucial to remember that generative AI cannot take the place of artists' and animators' labor. We are disseminating this information because we are convinced of the ability of technology to foster new forms of self-expression and to open doors for those who might not otherwise have them. It is our dream that everyone will eventually be able to use Movie Gen to produce high-quality videos and audio and realize their artistic dreams.`,

About 15 lakh spectators saw the amazing success of the IAF Air display at the Marina, however at the end of the display, two individuals were admitted to the hospital and five people died, while about 100 people had outpatient treatment at the government hospitals.
As early as 8 a.m., hundreds of people began to swarm Marina. People flocked to the beach to see the display, packing the buses, trains, and Metro for hours at a time.
Before long, the famous beach was clogged with traffic, and visitors had to walk a great distance to reach the marina.
Many had arrived with water and umbrellas in hand to shield themselves from the intense sun, following the advise. Thousands more had arrived unprepared as well. A senior police officer stated that five people who had come to see the air show fainted and died on Sunday afternoon after the event ended, when the crowd was enthralled by the numerous planes and their aerobatic skills. V. Karthikeyan, 34, of Thiruvottiyur's RMV Nagar neighborhood, had driven a two-wheeler with his wife and two-year-old son to the air show, according to the police. Following the occurrence, Karthikeyan passed out in the vicinity of the INS Adyar main gate while they were strolling down Rajaji Road. After being sent to the Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital (RGGH), he was declared dead.

In a another incidence, D. John, 56, a resident of Korukkupet, passed out next to the Parthasarathy arch on Kamarajar Salai. He had come for the air show with his wife Elisamma and nephew. At the same location, Srinivasan from Perungalathur passed out as well. According to the police, both were taken in an ambulance to the Government Omandurar Multispeciality hospital, but to no avail.
On the Marina's dunes, a second gentleman in his late thirtys was discovered deceased. 
He was recognized by the police as Dinesh Kumar, and a post-mortem would be conducted on his body at Government Royapettah Hospital. 
Due to dizziness, around 100 patients were hospitalized to the government hospitals near the Marina. Forty-five patients were treated at the Government Royapettah Hospital, 43 at Omandurar Hospital, and seven at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH). 

According to RGGGH Dean E. Therani Rajan, only two patients were admitted; the other patients received outpatient care. One patient was pronounced "dead on arrival" upon arriving at the hospital. The 34-year-old had no known medical conditions, but more details could only be obtained during a post-mortem, according to the Dean. 

Patients' main complaints were of extreme heat, humidity, and giddiness. "We received 43 complaints of giddiness from the same person. Increased temperature impairs the hypothalamus's ability to operate. The same is true for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which impairs key organ function. According to Dr. Therani Rajan, some persons have arrhythmia, or abnormal heartbeats, which can result in cardiac arrest and even death.

long though the audience was well-behaved and under control, thousands of people remained stranded for several hours long after the event ended because the public transportation systems malfunctioned. Many in the throng also expressed dissatisfaction with the government for failing to plan for facilities, particularly clean drinking water, for the sizable gathering.`,

    content:`The RBI had prohibited Paytm Payments Bank from enabling credit transactions in client accounts, including prepaid cards and wallets, or taking deposits.

According to a top company official on Sunday, Paytm's top focus right now is investing in its consumer payments business in an attempt to make up for lost user base as a result of RBI regulatory actions.
The RBI had prohibited Paytm Payments Bank from enabling credit transactions in client accounts, including prepaid cards and wallets, or taking deposits.

In order to concentrate on its primary business of financial services distribution and payment processing, Paytm sold its ticketing division to foodtech company Zomato in August for a sum of Rs 2,048 crore.
"Our major business is still processing payments, and the merchant side is still robust. Regulating restrictions, however, caused us to lose a sizable portion of our consumer base. During an interactive event hosted by the Calcutta Chapter of Young Indians, the youth wing of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma stated, "Going forward, we aim to reinvest in the consumer payments business area."

UPI payments are made by consumers, whereas QR code transactions are made by merchants.
The amount of monthly transactional users (MTU) dropped sharply from 10.4 crore in January to 7.7 crore in May, based on corporate data that is currently accessible. In June, the amount was 7.8 crore.
On the other hand, Paytm witnessed gradual expansion in the merchant segment, as seen by the rise in merchant numbers from 79 lakh during the June 2023 quarter to 109 lakh during the June 2024 quarter.

The company is utilizing the Third-Party Application Provider (TPAP) business model, according to Sharma.

It entails providing consumers with digital payment services through a range of platforms and apps. In order to streamline transactions and offer a user-friendly interface for services like bill payment, UPI payments, and other financial transactions, TPAPs work with banks and other financial institutions.`,

    content:`Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday to discuss a potential trade deal, and the two sides decided to support each other financially with over ₹6,300 crore. This agreement comes as the Maldives faced a foreign exchange crisis.

The two parties unveiled a new vision document for an all-encompassing economic and maritime security partnership, which includes important measures to increase trade, digitization, and financial cooperation as well as strengthen the Maldives' maritime surveillance capabilities through the supply of Indian radar systems and other equipment.

Following their discussions, Modi addressed a joint media conference with Muizzu to state that India is the Maldives' "closest neighbour and steadfast friend" and that it will continue to provide support in a variety of areas, including infrastructure development, defines, and development cooperation. 

The State Bank of India (SBI) has rolled over $100 million in Treasury bills for the Maldives this year. Speaking in Hindi, Modi stated that a currency exchange arrangement worth $400 million and ₹3,000 crore (₹30 billion) had been reached today in response to the Maldives' needs.

Muizzu, who took several measures to bring his nation closer to Beijing and lessen its reliance on New Delhi after winning the "India Out" election campaign last year, acknowledged India as a crucial ally for the development of infrastructure and socioeconomic conditions that "has stood by the Maldives during our times of need." 

"The Maldives will continue to be a true friend, dedicated to our shared vision of peace and development in our countries and our region," he continued.
As per Muizzu, the currency swap arrangement will play a crucial role in mitigating the current foreign exchange problems. Additionally, there was a consensus to "continue to be involved in initiatives that will strengthen the Maldives' economic stability and resilience." He said, not providing any specifics.

The Maldives side raised "a number of other points and requests" related financial aid, which will be looked into by New Delhi, according to Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri during a media conference. 

The results of the two-way meeting signalled a dramatic break from a particularly contentious period in New Delhi and Male's relationship. Ties plunged to an all-time low after Muizzu demanded India evacuate more than 80 Indian military personnel deployed in the archipelago to operate three aircraft and subsequently made moves to enhance defence and military cooperation with Turkey and China.`,

    content:`The W1 hybrid hyper car, was unveiled. Priced at a whopping GBP 2 million each, the cars are already assigned to clients.
Highlights
The W1, McLaren's replacement for the P1, has been revealed. 

399 units only, each costing GBP 2 million. 

driven by an electric motor coupled to a 4.0-liter V8 engine. 

Finally, McLaren Automotive has shown the eagerly anticipated P1 replacement. The British supercar manufacturer's most potent road-going vehicle to date is called the W1. According to McLaren, only 399 of the W1's high-priced, GBP 2 million vehicles will be produced; these vehicles have already been assigned to clients.
The W1 is the replacement for the P1, which was the F1's legendary heir. 

The RWD hyper car’s hybrid engine system combines a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 with an E-module, which is made up of an electric motor and a motor control unit with motorsport roots. The highest power output of any McLaren engine, 915 bhp, is produced by the flat-plane crank V8 alone, which can reach 9,200 rpm. An eight-speed dual-clutch transmission is used to transfer power to the back wheels. The 342 bhp electric motor, according to McLaren, weighs only 20 kg and has a particular output that is directly comparable to Formula 1 electric motors. The overall output is at 1258 horsepower and 1340 Nm of peak torque. 
The W1 can sprint from 0 to 100 kmph in 2.7 seconds, go from 0 to 200 kmph in 5.8 seconds, and go from 0 to 300 kmph in less than 12.7 seconds, with a maximum speed restriction of 350 kmph. 
The W1's design differs greatly from the rest of McLaren's line-up in terms of appearance. Its shape is less curved and more upright than that of the P1, its predecessor. The headlamps on the front end have an aggressive appearance, and there are several air vents to improve aerodynamic efficiency. Anhedral doors that are hinged to the roof and rotate upward are standard on the W1. The enormous rear haunches with air intakes that gather air from the outlets on the front wheel arches are among the other design features. 
The large diffuser and the slender, flowing tail lamps make up the majority of the back end.
The W1 has lightweight upholstery and movable pedals inside. Additional features include a Bowers & Wilkins sound system and an 8-inch touchscreen with Apple Carplay and Android auto compatibility.

The W1's advanced aerodynamic characteristics, which combine to produce a noteworthy 1000 kg of downforce, are another talking point. The pushrod and inboard damper system's lower wishbones have been increased considerably to add to the suspension's aerodynamic efficiency and maintain the car's rear-wheel drive's clean air flow. The ride height is decreased by 37 mm in the front and 17 mm in the back when Race mode is engaged.`,

      title:'Google begins releasing new features for Android phones that prevent theft.',
      date:'october 8,2024',
      content:`According to Google, these features are intended to improve security and protect user information in the event that a phone is stolen.
Announced at the I/O 2024 developer conference in May this year, Google has now begun rolling out its new enhanced theft protection capabilities for Android phones. According to Google, these features are intended to improve security and protect user information in the event that a phone is stolen. Android 10 or later versions of phones will support the three new functionalities.

Three new capabilities to prevent theft are available: Remote Lock, Offline Device Lock, and Theft Detection Lock.
Using Google AI, the Theft Detection Lock feature detects when someone snatches your phone out of your hand and tries to ride, drive, or run away with it. It will be promptly locked down to prevent your information from falling into the wrong hands if a theft motion is detected. 

When a thief attempts to disconnect your phone for an extended length of time, the Offline Device Lock function activates. The feature automatically locks your screen to help protect your data even while your device is off the grid. Android may also identify additional signals that your device may be in the wrong hands. 

The Remote Lock option can be useful if your phone has been stolen. Using just your phone number and a brief security challenge, you will be able to lock the screen of any device. Google writes in a blog post that "this buys you time to recover your account details and access additional helpful options in Find My Device, including sending a full factory reset command to completely wipe the device."
The features are being rolled out globally, albeit gradually. While some users may receive the features later, others may already have them. We checked on two Android phones but couldn’t see them, so it may take some time until the theft protection capabilities reach all Android users.`,

For the second quarter that ended in September, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) reported a 1.1 percent quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) decline in net profit to Rs 11,909 crore, falling short of Street estimates. According to the stock exchange filing, the largest IT service provider in India saw an increase in operational revenue to Rs 64,259 crore in Q2 FY24.

TCS generated revenue of Rs 63,938 crore and a net profit of Rs 12,420 crore during July to September.
Additionally, TCS announced the payment of a Rs. 10 interim dividend per share. The record date to ascertain if stockholders are eligible for the corporate action is set for Friday, October 18, 2024, by the IT bellwether. Previously, on July 19, 2024, the business distributed an interim dividend of Rs 10. 

The company said in a statement that the Energy, Resources, and Utilities sectors drove revenue growth. 

"This quarter, like in the previous several, we observed the cautious patterns holding true. In the midst of an unpredictable geopolitical environment, BFSI, our largest vertical, began to rebound. TCS CEO and Managing Director K Krithivasan stated, "We also observed a significant result in our Growth Markets.

Analysts had predicted that the ramp-up of significant acquisitions, especially its ongoing relationship with BSNL, would drive the IT giant Tata Group's Q2 revenue. They also predicted that strong deal execution and the company's expansion in North America, BFSI, and retail would support the net profit.
While continental Europe increased by 1.8 percent and the UK grew by 4.6 percent YoY in CC terms, North America continued to slow down by 2.1 percent YoY. 

TCS's total order book was $8.6 billion, representing a 23.2% YoY decrease and a 3.61% sequential gain. TCS closed a number of retail deals this quarter, including, to mention a few, Primark, McDonald's, and Croma. There are presently 600 AI/Gen AI projects being worked on by the business.

      content:`On October 24th, the Core Ultra 200S series—which emphasizes performance per watt and an integrated NPU—will be released.*

The increased heat and power consumption of Intel's desktop CPUs is finally being addressed. Arriving on October 24th, Intel's new flagship Core Ultra 200S family of CPUs is designed to run cooler and more efficiently than its 14th generation counterparts by concentrating on performance per watt. These are also the first enthusiast desktop CPUs from Intel with an integrated neural processing unit, or NPU, to speed up AI activities. These CPUs are codenamed Arrow Lake S.

For aficionados in desktop and mobile, "Arrow Lake will deliver Intel's best performance," says Josh Newman, general manager and vice president of product marketing for client computing. "As well as delivering the first Intel AI PC for enthusiasts in both the desktop and mobile performance space, Arrow Lake is also delivering that performance at significantly lower power levels than previous generations of Intel enthusiast products."
Intel has made significant efforts to lower the power consumption of their chips, which is at the core of the Arrow Lake architecture. The Intel Core CPU versions 13 and 14 were both power-hungry, frequently consuming significantly more power than their AMD counterparts. When doing routine desktop chores, the power consumption will be halved thanks to these new Core Ultra 200S series CPUs. Additionally, Intel promises to save a significant amount of power when gaming.

According to Intel Vice President of Client Computing Group Robert Hallock, "You'll see about half the power consumption at the desktop." Additionally, employing a single core will result in around half the power. 50 to 150 watts will be used for gaming, depending on the title and how it behaves.


In contrast to its current Core i9-14900K, Intel showcased Assassin's Creed Mirage operating on its flagship Core Ultra 9 285K during a recent press briefing. In Mirage, the Ultra 9 285K produced performance that was comparable to or better at 80 watts less, and according to Intel, it can save up to 58 watts of power when playing games like Call of Duty.`,

Users can instruct the AI to create photos, and after a few repetitions, they can selectively improve the output. The software was restricted to the most recent Pixel 9 series, but it appears to function effectively with photos of individuals. A recent online visit to the Gemini service revealed that Imagen 3 is also accessible through the service, even at the free tier (via NotebookCheck).
For the past few months, Google has been using the AI Test Kitchen to test Imagen 3 on Gemini. We are seeing a pop-up regarding these image generating capabilities on Gemini, which suggests that the firm chose to make them available to all customers after a few months of testing. In contrast to the Pixel Studio program, which transformed your prompt's artistic definitions into drop-down menus with options, Google's Gemini deployment prioritizes image quality, detail, and greater photorealism than the outgoing model.

While the free use of Google's award-winning text-to-image model, which boasts unexpected realism, is undoubtedly beneficial, a considerable portion of Pixel 9 series buyers purchased the device specifically for the Pixel Studio app's ease of use. The phone isn't even a year old yet, and it may seem unfair to Google to make the Imagen 3 so widely available to Pixel customers who paid actual money for the AI intelligence.`,

In addition to the humanoid robots, the electric vehicle manufacturer unveiled Cyber cab, a larger self-driving automobile that can fit up to 20 people, and Cyber cab, a self-driving robo taxi.

In a video demonstration shown at the ceremony, Optimus was also seen performing household chores like picking up deliveries and watering plants. "Among you, the Optimus will stroll. You can approach them directly, and they will offer beverages, 
It may take a further two years for anyone hoping to utilize Tesla's Optimus for factory labor or dog walking, though, since Musk has previously stated that the humanoid robots won't be ready for usage until 2026. Nevertheless, they were far more visible on the Tesla factory floor.

Musk has consistently stated that he sees applications for the humanoid Optimus robots outside of industrial tasks. Musk revealed to the public, for the first time, a bipedal Optimus prototype that could walk on stage and wave to the audience in 2022. The Optimus Gen 2 was seen to be being remotely controlled in a video, raising doubts about the robot's ability to move on its own. 

The demonstration on Thursday demonstrated that Tesla has actually successfully developed autonomous locomotion with Optimus.`,

      content:`I look forward to carrying on the legacy of Mr. Ratan N. Tata and the Founders of the Tata Group," Noel Tata stated in response to his appointment. Established over a century ago, the Tata Trusts represent a distinctive means of pursuing social good.
Among these are the two main trusts, the Sir Ratan Tata Trust and the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, which together control over 50% of Tata Sons, the main holding company and corporation that promotes the Tata brands. Thirteen charitable trusts together own sixty-six percent of Tata Sons.

Tata Trust chairmen have always come from the Parsi community. It has also been revealed that the community wanted someone with a Tata surname to lead these trusts, which made Noel Tata the most obvious candidate. There were rumours circulating prior to his selection that Mehli Mistry, a close confidante of Ratan Tata, was also a contender. However, this could not be verified.

In a joint meeting in Mumbai, the trustees of the several Tata Trusts expressed their condolences for the passing of Ratan Tata, the chairman of the Tata Trusts, and "recalled his yeoman services not only to the Tata Group but also to nation building," according to a statement.

The announcement also stated, "It was unanimously decided in separate meetings held immediately thereafter to appoint Mr. Noel Naval Tata as the Chairman of the various Trusts that constitute the Tata Trusts and also designate him as Chairman, Tata Trusts." 

It further stated that his appointment is effective right now. As the sixth chairman of the Sir Ratan Tata Trust and the eleventh chairman of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, Noel assumed these roles.

"I look forward to carrying on the legacy of Mr. Ratan N. Tata and the Founders of the Tata Group," Noel Tata stated in response to his appointment. The Tata Trusts, which were established over a century ago, offer a special means of pursuing social good.`,

      content:`As a result of this upgrade, HAL is now the 14th Maharatna CPSE, a distinction that will strengthen its financial and operational independence.
With this promotion, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) is now a Maharatna Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE). Following Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's clearance, the Department of Public Enterprises announced the upgrade through a post on X (previously Twitter) on October 12.

Two high-level bodies, led by the Finance Secretary on the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) and the Cabinet Secretary on the Apex Committee, had already recommended HAL's upgrade.

Under the Department of Defence Production (DoDP), HAL reported a net profit of Rs 7,595 crore and annual revenue of Rs. 28,162 crore for the fiscal year 2023–2024. As a result of this upgrade, HAL is now the 14th Maharatna CPSE, a distinction that will strengthen its financial and operational independence. 

The government gave "Maharatna" status to Oil India in August of last year, making it the most recent corporation to do so. 

There are currently 14 "Maharatna" public sector enterprises (PSUs) in India, including the recently renamed Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and well-known companies like BHEL, BPCL, Coal India, GAIL, HPCL, Indian Oil, NTPC, ONGC, Power Grid, SAIL, Oil India, REC, and PFC.

A corporation must meet strict financial requirements in order to be granted Maharatna status: an average annual net value of more than Rs 15,000 crore, an average annual turnover exceeding Rs 25,000 crore, and an average annual net profit of more than Rs 5,000 crore during the previous three years.
PSUs with Maharatna status have more freedom to invest in capital projects, such as replacements or new purchases, without any financial restrictions. These businesses must also run on their own, without reliance on government assurances or budgetary support.

In contrast, corporations having Navratna status can invest up to ₹1,000 crore, or 15% of their net worth, in a single project without obtaining previous government approval. This means that the category confers greater financial and operational freedom.`,

      title:'Verified AI Hack Raises New Gmail Security Alert for 2.5 Billion Users',
      date:'october 13,2024',
      content:`Although Google has put in place progressively more advanced safeguards to prevent hackers from accessing your Gmail account, hackers are also developing AI-driven assaults. Google estimates that over 2.5 billion people utilize the Gmail service at any given time. That it is such a target for hackers and con artists is understandable. What you should know is as follows.

The Most Recent AI-Powered Gmail Attack Is Pretty Awesome

Microsoft solutions consultant Sam Mitrovic has cautioned others after nearly falling for a “super realistic AI scam call” that might fool even the most seasoned users.
It began a week before Mitrovic became aware of how sophisticated the attack was against him. In a blog post alerting other Gmail users to the potential threat, Mitrovic describes, "I received a notification to approve a Gmail account recovery attempt." One well-known technique used in phishing attacks is the request for confirmation of account recovery or password reset, which leads the victim to a phony login page where they are required to provide their login information in order to report the request as not coming from them.

Naturally, Mitrovic was not buying into this and turned off the notification that seemed to be from the United States as well as a missed call that seemed to be from Google in Sydney, Australia, around forty minutes later. Thus far, it seems quite simple and avoidable. Then, almost exactly one week later, the real fun began with another notice request for permission of account recovery, followed forty minutes later by a phone call. This time, Mitrovic didn't miss the call and answered it. An American voice identifying itself as Google assistance verified that the Gmail account had been the subject of questionable behaviour.

After I told him no, he inquired as to whether or not he had logged in from Germany, to which I replied in the negative, Mitrovic added. All of this is intended to instill dread in the recipient and trust in the caller. At this point, the phishing plan took a quick and extremely clever turn for the worst. Mitrovic was notified by the alleged Google support agent that an intruder had gained access to his Gmail account for the previous seven days and had taken possession of account information. Mitrovic remembered the missed call and recovery notification from a week prior, so this raised red flags.

While he was still talking, Mitrovic Googled the phone number he was being contacted from and found that it did, in fact, connect to Google company pages. This alone is a cunning ploy that will probably trick a lot of gullible customers who are caught up in the moment's fear because it wasn't a Google support number; rather, it was about receiving calls from Google Assistant. "You will be informed at the beginning of the conversation that Google is the caller and why they are calling. The reader is kindly informed by the 100% authentic page that "You can expect the call to come from an automated system or, in some cases, a manual operator."`,

He is able to assist. He is a dancer. He's got selfie skills. He is able to speak. He is capable of everything "you want." That robot, Tesla's Optimus, can be a humanoid companion. At Tesla's 'We, Robot' event on Thursday in California, many humanoid Optimus robots were observed pouring beverages to spectators and strolling the ramp.
It can pretty much do anything you ask of it. Perhaps a teacher. It can get groceries, mow your lawn, walk your dog, watch your kids, be your friend, and serve drinks. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, stated, "Anything you can think of, it will work and it's going to be awesome," when unveiling the most recent launch.
A demo film aired during the occasion showed Optimus carrying out home tasks like watering plants, wiping down the kitchen counter, unloading groceries, and engaging in play with kids in addition to picking up deliveries.
Musk demonstrated his claims by bringing several Optimus robots to the gathering and asking guests to treat them kindly. They will serve beverages at the bar, and you can approach them directly. Just having humanoid robots is an amazing experience. They are right in front of you, where you are.
Long term, Optimus will cost between $20,000 and $30,000, according to Musk.

Optimus is astounding the internet.
"Didn't it feel like you were on some time travel trip to be there?" a user said. Undoubtedly, this incident changed history. 

A few users expressed disapproval with Optimus's ability to interact. "Is this really Optimus talking?" a user from X asked. I have the impression that someone is behind it. 
"The ones mingling and serving drinks were remotely operated but still really impressive," another person remarked.

"I'd like to purchase an Optimus once its hand dexterity matches that of a human being. especially if it has the ability to learn and acquire information on a variety of topics. A second person expressed interest in the idea and remarked, "I could use the help working on our rental properties and around our place in Arizona."`,

According to a livestream from Elon Musk's SpaceX Company, the "super heavy booster" had taken off attached to the unmanned Star ship rocket minutes earlier. It then made an impeccable controlled return to the same pad in Texas, where two enormous mechanical "chopsticks" reached out from the launch tower to bring the slowly descending booster to a stop.
Soon later, Star ship’s top stage descended into the Indian Ocean as scheduled, a milestone that was celebrated.

On the fifth test flight of the vehicle, he declared, "Ship landed precisely on target!" "The second of the two goals was accomplished." 

Employees of the corporation cheered as the booster was successfully "caught" at the launch pad in Texas.
On the livestream for the firm, a SpaceX representative remarked, "People, this is a day for the engineering history books." 

Yestraday At 7:25 a.m. (12:25 GMT), the SpaceX facility in southern Texas successfully launched into bright skies.
SpaceX made history in June when it successfully completed its first splashdown with Star ship; a prototype spacecraft that Elon Musk thinks could eventually transport people to Mars. 

In order to increase the likelihood of success, SpaceX says that its engineers have "spent years preparing and months testing for the booster catch attempt, with technicians pouring tens of thousands of hours into building the infrastructure."`,

      content:`Monday night, hours after senior diplomats were ejected from both nations in an intensifying geopolitical spat, Canadian police accused Indian diplomats and consular personnel of engaging in "clandestine" and "criminal" operations within the nation. 


The head of the Royal Canadian Mounted police (RCMP) told reporters during a hurriedly scheduled press conference that the agency has proof of "agents" acting on behalf of the Indian government and engaging in harassment, extortion, intimidation, and coercion. Commissioner Mike Duheme said to reporters that investigations had shown that Indian consular and diplomat personnel stationed in Canada took advantage of their official positions to carry out covert operations like gathering intelligence for the Indian government, either directly or through intermediaries; 

and other people who took voluntary or coercive action.
The Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, accused India last year of assassinating the well-known Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in the British Columbian province. The claims made by the RCMP represent the first official look by the police into the breadth and depth of India's purported activities in Canada.

"We will never tolerate the involvement of a foreign government threatening and killing Canadian citizens on Canadian soil," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declared on Monday night. India erred greatly when it decided to target Canadians with its diplomats and organized crime.

The RCMP has obtained "ample, clear and concrete evidence which identified six individuals as persons of interest in the Nijjar case," according to Canada's foreign minister, Mélanie Joly. 

She claimed that although India was asked to participate with the probe and forgo its diplomatic and consular immunity, it refused. 

Joly stated, "Unfortunately, since India refused to comply and considering the continuous worries about Canadians' safety, Canada served notices of expulsion to these individuals."
Because "getting to the bottom of this is still in the interest of both of our countries," she requested that the Indian government assist the current probe. 
Activists have charged India in recent months with a well-planned campaign of "transnational terrorism" directed on Sikhs.`,

      content:`In India, the Samsung Galaxy Ring is currently accessible for pre-order. Initially accessible in a limited number of areas, the next-generation health and fitness wearable from the South Korean electronics manufacturer was introduced in July alongside the Galaxy Z 6 series foldable devices. The Galaxy Ring is currently expanding to new markets, one of which being India. Pre-orders for the Galaxy Ring are open till October 15, which may indicate that India will soon be able to buy Samsung's new ring-shaped wearable.

Samsung Galaxy Ring: Specifics of the pre-order

Customers who are interested in buying the Samsung Galaxy Ring can reserve a device on the company's official website in India or through the online retailers Flipkart and Amazon for a nominal fee of Rs 1,999. Samsung has attested to the refundable nature of this token sum.

Customers who pre-reserve a Galaxy Ring will be among the first to purchase the smartphone when it launches, according to Samsung. Furthermore, buyers who pre-reserve a Galaxy Ring from Samsung will receive a Wireless Charger Duo at no additional cost. A charging case and data cord are included with the Galaxy Ring.

Samsung Galaxy Ring: Specifics

The Galaxy Ring will initially be free of charge for users who visit Samsung's website. This suggests that, like Samsung Galaxy Watches, it will connect with the Samsung Health app. This methodology is distinct from certain smart rings provided by other companies, like Oura, which conceal sophisticated health data behind a paywall.
The Samsung Galaxy Ring, which was introduced in July of this year, has a thin design and weighs between 2.3 and 3g, depending on the size. Titanium Black, Titanium Silver, and Titanium Gold are the three color selections and nine size variations for the Galaxy Ring. It has 10ATM water resistance and is constructed of Grade 5 titanium. Up to seven days of battery life between charges is what Samsung boasts. 
Additionally, Samsung has integrated Galaxy AI into the Galaxy Ring to produce comprehensive health reports that highlight different health metrics. The Galaxy Ring with Galaxy AI helps users concentrate on their daily attempts to develop by offering an Energy Score measure that makes recommendations depending on the users' current physical state. 
A number of health parameters, including sleep, activity, sleeping heart rate, and sleeping heart rate variability, are measured by the ring and used to compute this score.`,

      date:'october 15,2024',
      content:`Adleman, Shamir, and Rivest. These are the people who created the well-known RSA Algorithm.
Chinese researchers have revealed a way to break classic encryption using D-Wave's quantum annealing systems, which could hasten the day when quantum computers actually threaten commonly used cryptography systems. This is a potentially concerning development for global cybersecurity.

The paper, titled "Quantum Annealing Public Key Cryptographic Attack Algorithm Based on D-Wave Advantage," which was published in the Chinese Journal of Computers, described how D-Wave's machines were used to attack symmetric encryption systems and break RSA encryption, raising serious concerns about the future of cybersecurity. 
Under the direction of Shanghai University's Wang Chao, the research team discovered that D-Wave's quantum computers may maximize problem-solving in a way that makes it feasible to breach encryption techniques like RSA.

In the publication, the researchers stated, "We successfully factored a 22-bit RSA integer using the D-Wave Advantage, demonstrating the potential for quantum machines to tackle cryptographic problems."

The work demonstrates how quantum annealing can transform cryptography assaults into more manageable combinatorial optimization issues. 

The researchers stated, "This is the first time that a real quantum computer has posed a substantial threat to multiple full-scale SPN structured algorithms in use today." The SPN structure is the foundation of many popular encryption techniques. 

How does this affect cybersecurity, and why? 
This research has important ramifications. Although this study indicates that the timescale for such threats may be significantly shorter than anticipated, experts have long predicted that quantum computers might someday crack today's encryption. 

"Data security and privacy for a variety of businesses may be gravely jeopardized by the development of quantum computing, impacting basic concepts like confidentiality, integrity, and authentication," Kaur continued. "Revaluating the security of these cryptographic techniques is crucial in light of this." 

The group made the point that information that is encrypted now might be vulnerable if hackers take it with the goal of decrypting it later on when quantum technology develops.`,

      title:`"If Trust Is Lacking...": Jaishankar's Strong SCO Speech in Pakistan Critiques Cross-Border Terrorism`,
      date:'october 16,2024',
      content:`During the SCO meeting in Islamabad on Wednesday, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar sent a strong message to Pakistan over the problem of cross-border terrorism. He suggested that the country should consider the causes behind the deterioration of ties between the two neighbours.

"If trust is lacking or cooperation is inadequate, if the friendship has fallen short and good neighbourliness is missing somewhere, there are surely reasons to introspect and causes to address," Jaishankar stated at the SCO Council of Heads of Government (CHG) summit. The minister went on, "Without specifically addressing Pakistan, 

"It is unlikely that cross-border activities that promote terrorism, extremism, and separatism will also foster parallel developments in trade, energy flows, connectivity, and people-to-people interactions."

In a social media message before leaving Islamabad, he thanked the Pakistani government, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for their kindness and hospitality. 
Relations between Pakistan and India 
Following the Pulwama terror incident in February 2019, India's airplanes struck a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training centre in Balakot, Pakistan, severely straining ties between the two countries. After India stated on August 5, 2019, that it was splitting the state into two union territories and withdrawing Jammu and Kashmir's special powers, the relationship between the two countries further worsened.

Following New Delhi's repeal of Article 370, Pakistan reduced its diplomatic relations with India. India has consistently stated that it wants to have regular neigh borly relations with Pakistan, but it also insists that Islamabad must establish an atmosphere free from hatred and terror in order for these contacts to take place.

Greetings and exchanges 
Jaishankar made his speech the day after he greeted Shehbaz Sharif, the prime minister of Pakistan, shortly after arriving in the country's capital to attend a Shanghai Cooperation Organization conference. The brief conversation happened during a dinner party that Sharif threw for the delegates of the SCO member nations at his house.
After exchanging cordial handshakes, Jaishankar and Sharif had a brief conversation. The prime minister of Pakistan greeted each and every head of the SCO member country delegation. Around 3:30 pm (local time), Jaishankar's plane touched down at the Nur Khan airfield outside of the Pakistani capital, where he was welcomed by high-ranking Pakistani authorities.`,

      date:'october 16,2024',
      content:`According to Jyotiraditya Scindia, Union Minister of Communications, India will administratively allot spectrum for satellite communication in accordance with the Telecommunications Act of 2023. This is viewed as a setback for Reliance Jio, which has been advocating for a spectrum auction and a victory for companies like Starlink, owned by Elon Musk, and Kuiper, owned by Amazon.

"Spectrum will be distributed administratively for satcom. that does not imply that spectrum is free of charge. During a press conference at the India Mobile Congress, Scindia stated, "The TRAI will determine what that cost is and what the formula of that costing is going to be."

All around the world, satellite spectrum is distributed administratively. Thus, India is acting in the same manner as the rest of the world. On the other hand, if you do want to put it up for auction, you will be taking a unique approach to doing things. Spectrum used for satellites is shared spectrum. "How can you price spectrum individually if it's shared?" he said.

The ups and downs in the industry have created a high-profile rivalry between well-funded competitors, placing Reliance Jio up against companies like Elon Musk's Starlink.

Reliance Jio had written to the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) earlier this month, objecting to the idea of allocating satellite spectrum administratively and advocating for an auction procedure. But in reaction to the advancement,

"That would be unprecedented," Musk stated, "as this spectrum was long designated as shared spectrum for satellites by the ITU."
On Tuesday, Sunil Bharti Mittal, the chairwoman of Bharti Enterprises, which holds a majority investment in OneWeb, stated that businesses wishing to provide satellite services to retail customers and in metropolitan areas must purchase spectrum and adhere to the same rules.


"And those satellite businesses that wish to operate in cities and cater to individual consumers only have to pay the standard telecom license fees." They are subject to the same rules. They have the same requirements as telecom firms, including purchasing spectrum, paying license fees, and securing networks. of the telecom companies,” Mittal said.`,

      title:"Huawei's stunning Mate XT 'Tri-Foldable' Phone… and Sceptical, Too",
      date:'october 18,2024',
      content:`Although they are a relatively new gadget type, most manufacturers of foldable phones only produce two variants: one that opens like a traditional flip phone and the other that unfolds like a book. But a more stylish cousin with a bigger display and the ability to fold twice to reveal three displays has just surpassed the book-style folding.

Huawei unveiled the Mate XT Ultimate Design in September. This phone has two folding hinges that together generate three displays. It provides the unique opportunity to carry a tablet in your pocket. Triple-screen foldables were limited to the walls of tech conference showcases as concept phones prior to Huawei. That all changed when the Chinese tech giant introduced a product that was reasonably priced, at least in its native market of China.

In light of US sanctions, Huawei's Mate XT represents a big victory, and it may set the stage for a wider trend among phone manufacturers like Samsung and Tecno, which have all dabbled with comparable designs. However, given the ongoing issues with cost and durability, it is still unclear whether this is the phone of the future.
When completely extended, the Mate XT Ultimate Design's screen is 10.2 inches, making it comparable in size to an iPad. At just 3.6 millimetres thick when unfurled, it also breaks the record for being the thinnest foldable phone ever produced. It also has a dual mode that allows it to open to a screen size of about 8 inches, making it similar to folding books like Google's Pixel 9 Pro, Fold.

Huawei devised a hinge system that combines two tracks that function in tandem to permit both inside and outward folds, achieving the technical marvel of a dual-folding screen. It is inaccurate to refer to the phone as a trifold phone as it is commonly used. Actually, it folds in just two locations, dividing its huge screen into three thin small panels. It currently retails in China for $2,800, which is the initial price after conversion from 19,999 yuan. On September 20, the day the iPhone 16 series debuted in its initial wave of nations and territories, including China, Huawei started selling it. 
Because of its high pricing, Huawei is unlikely to see significant growth in sales with the Mate XT Ultimate Design. Nonetheless, the introduction of a triple-screen phone manufactured by Huawei represents the business's inventiveness and advancement in the smartphone space, in spite of US sanctions, signifying a symbolic win for the brand. 

US sanctions that began to cripple the Chinese tech giant's phone business in 2019 almost completely destroyed Huawei's smartphone division. The company's phones became less competitive in the international market as a result of the sanctions, which prevented access to cutting-edge American technology that is necessary for smartphone semiconductors and critical software.
The Mate XT Ultimate Design from Huawei may serve as the impetus for a new generation of foldable smartphones. Although even more specialized than standard foldables, triple-screen foldables`,

      title:'THE INTERNET SPEEDS ARE BEYOND IMAGINATION! 6G TESTS BEGIN',
      date:'october 18,2024',
      content:`In wireless data transmission, researchers at University College London have discovered a revolutionary breakthrough. Reaching a phenomenal 938 gigabits per second (Gbps). This is nine thousand times quicker than the current standard 5G connection. To put things in perspective, you could download over 20 movies every second at this speed. an enormous improvement in internet functionality.

Under the direction of Professor Zhixin Liu, the group used a brand-new frequency spectrum that had never been tested before to reach this incredible speed. They combined radio waves and light to transmit data, operating in the frequency range of 5 GHz to 150 GHz. Their combined technological prowess allowed them to surpass earlier speed restrictions.
Microwave photonics and high-speed electronics are two cutting-edge technologies that the team uses to great effect. With the use of quick digital to analog converters, they produced signals in the 5-75 GHz range. For even higher frequencies, such as W-band (75-110 GHz) and D-band (110-150 GHz), they combined frequency-locked lasers with light-based signals. Using this technique, a very effective system that can support the upcoming wireless communication generation was constructed. 

Professor Liu likened this change to building a gigantic 10-lane freeway out of a little, single-lane road. "More bandwidth is needed to carry more data, just as we need wider roads to accommodate more cars," Liu stated. To make this technology available to people, the team is also in discussions with network providers and smartphone manufacturers soon.

Japan's Progress with 6G 
In the meantime, fascinating advancements in 6G technology are taking place in Japan. A technology developed by many Japanese telecom companies can provide data 20 times quicker than 5G. Up to 100 meters can be covered at speeds of up to 100 Gbps with this technology. Which, when compared to current wireless systems, is a considerable improvement. 

The future of radio access networks (RANs), which require wireless rates greater than 100 Gbps, depends on these developments. The way we use the internet on a daily basis will alter as this technology advances. Accelerating and streamlining the entire process, from work to play.`,

      title:"With the most recent spectrum ruling, India prepares for Elon Musk's Star link internet services to eventually launch in India.",
      date:'october 19,2024',
      content:`Elon Musk's satellite internet project, Starlink, is about to formally enter the Indian market after years of navigating regulatory obstacles. The Indian government's recent decision to distribute satellite spectrum administratively as opposed to through an auction has allowed Starlink to increase its worldwide footprint and penetrate one of the biggest unexplored markets for satellite-based broadband services.

What does the ruling signify?
The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) in India recently made the decision to administratively allot spectrum for services related to satellite communication. Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, two of the largest local telecom companies, were not amused by this action. 
It promoted an auction-based strategy, claiming it would level the playing field. Rather, the government adopted the global administrative allocation standard, which Musk has openly endorsed as the global norm for satellite communications.

Starlink and other satellite internet service providers, including OneWeb and Jio Satellite Communications, can now obtain access to satellite spectrum without having to participate in pricey auctions thanks to this administrative path. To maintain fairness, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) will continue to oversee spectrum pricing.
India's Starlink's past 
India has long been a target market for Starlink because of the vast majority of its rural residents lack access to dependable internet service. For its satellite-based internet services, Starlink first accepted preorders in 2021. However, the Indian government ordered the corporation to abide by local rules before accepting bookings, which led to bureaucratic obstacles and the company having to issue refunds to clients. Starlink has been obtaining the required clearances ever since, working behind the scenes. After almost three years of attempts, Starlink may now be able to formally enter the market thanks to this new change in regulation, which would be a major triumph.

Musk's remarks 
Elon Musk has made it clear that he supports the administrative distribution of spectrum and has labeled any attempt to auction off satellite spectrum as "unprecedented." He thinks that the ability of satellite service providers like Starlink to deliver reasonably priced services may be hampered by the auctioning of spectrum set aside for satellite communications, as advocated by Mukesh Ambani's Reliance. 
It is anticipated that the launch of Starlink will completely transform internet access in underserved and rural parts of India. Low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites from Starlink offer high-speed internet services in areas where installing fiber or other conventional infrastructure would be too expensive or unfeasible. This might provide millions of Indians access to dependable internet for the first time and drastically narrow the digital divide.`,

      content:`One of the top GenAI start-ups, Perplexity AI, is launching a number of new services for its paying commercial clients that will help them make wise financial decisions. These consist of a data repository, a financial information tool, and a knowledge search platform. 

Businesses can use its "Internal Knowledge Search" to do simultaneous web and file searches from within the organization. 

"Our goal is for Perplexity to serve as the primary knowledge base and research platform for all users," stated Aravind Srinivas, the creator of Perplexity AI, during a media interview. He continued by saying that users would benefit from it when it came to research inputs like documents, private information, and due diligence. 

According to the company, utilizing internal research, call notes, and the most recent news in the sector to assist financial services firms in performing more thorough due diligence is one of the feature's main use cases. 

Perplexity for Finance, a new product from Perplexity AI, offers real-time stock quotes, past earnings reports, industry peer comparisons, and thorough business financial analysis—all presented in an enjoyable user interface. The financial implications of these choices could reach the billions of dollars. Thus, it makes sense to use a tool to increase your clarity, according to Srinivas. 

Soon, Perplexity AI will offer Enterprise Pro clients with active subscriptions third-party proprietary data integrations with Fact Set and Crunch base. According to Srinivas, "We'll also do the same for verticals outside finance, like legal and health."

Perplexity has the potential to become the go-to resource for capital market research with this kind of data integration, potentially upending other online forums and websites. What's stated on it might have an impact on share prices!," an X user commented. 

The Latest Development in Financial Analysis? 
Perplexity AI's new financial analysis function can assist banks and fintech companies—both of which are now internal—that are concerned about data leaks. 
Many services, including as Bloomberg Terminal, Stockopedia, Refinitiv Eikon, Yahoo Finance, Fidelity Investments, Robinhood, Zerodha, and Groww, are now relied upon by individuals. Still, many businesses have found it difficult to fully utilize generative AI.
"Await their consumption of all the documents and reports. This is Google Finance or Yahoo Finance's next generation. A user on X stated, "A smart bank, wealth management, or securities company would be partnering with Perplexity AI to build this into their platform/app." 

Third City independent consultant Michael J. Miraflor compared the tool to a Bloomberg Terminal for regular consumers, asking, "Is this... For normal people, Bloomberg Terminal Lite? (I realize it's not the intended use, but there are numerous instances of AI information aggregators that are headed in that way.) 

Other top financial organizations are developing GenAI products to offer better services, much like Perplexity's product.`,

      date:'october 21,2024',
      content:`According to reports, Meta is working on a chat memory function for Meta AI on WhatsApp that would allow the bot to retain user preferences for more tailored conversations.

After voice message capabilities for Meta AI chats were first introduced, this new feature attempts to improve the chatbot's personal touch. 
The most recent WhatsApp beta for Android (version 2.24.22.9), which is not yet accessible to consumers, reveals that the company is developing a new chat memory improvement for Meta AI discussions, according to WABetaInfo. By selecting this option, the chatbot will be able to remember user-provided data and provide more individualized responses in subsequent exchanges. 

Utilizing Meta AI to Recall User Preferences 
Meta AI is able to recall a wide range of personal information, including birthdays, conversational styles, allergies, and preferences for particular books, podcasts, and documentaries. 

According to the forthcoming Memory section, Meta AI "automatically remembers certain parts of your chat to give more relevant responses," highlighting what it remembers. With a "remember this" command, users can manually preserve information, which they can then change or remove whenever they choose. 

According to WABetaInfo, the memory capability will significantly increase the level of customisation in interactions with Meta AI. Meta AI can provide personalized advice and suggestions by keeping user data. For example, it won't recommend meals that the user is allergic to or hates. Creating a more engaging and genuine experience that resembles a personal assistant. 
The research highlights that users would retain full control over the data that Meta AI retains. This enables them to change or remove particular information whenever they choose. 

Meta has not disclosed a launch date or verified the specifics of this functionality.

A Chat Memory feature is being added to WhatsApp by Meta AI to provide more individualized user experiences. It will provide customized solutions by remembering preferences and specifics. Although no formal announcement has been made, the upgrade is anticipated to debut shortly and allows users to manage their data for privacy.`,
