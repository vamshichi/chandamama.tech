    title:'OpenAI introduces a new "Canvas" Customized ChatGPT interface for writing and coding tasks',
    image:openAi,
    date:'october 4,2024',
    content:`On Thursday, OpenAI unveiled a brand-new interface for using ChatGPT that it calls "canvas." The software opens a workspace for writing and coding tasks in a separate window that opens next to the standard chat window. Users can write directly on the canvas or use code, then highlight specific areas of their work to have the model make edits. On Thursday, Canvas will go live in beta for ChatGPT Plus and Teams users; Enterprise and Edu users will get it the following week.

A number of consumer AI companies are coming together around editable workspaces as a useful application of generative AI. Similar functionalities are available in ChatGPT's new interface as in Anthropic's Artifacts, which was released in June, and Cursor, the popular coding companion. To expand its paid user base, OpenAI is rushing to match rival services and introduce whole new features in ChatGPT.

Even if AI chatbots nowadays aren't able to do complex tasks with just one instruction, they can frequently provide a useful beginning point. Editable workspaces, such as canvas, let users make corrections to incorrect portions of an AI chatbot's output without requiring them to carefully examine their prompt and write a new section of code.

In a demo with TechCrunch, OpenAI product manager Daniel Levine stated, "This is just a more natural interface for collaborating with ChatGPT."

Levine was required to choose "GPT-4o with canvas" from ChatGPT's model picker drop-down menu during our demonstration. But according to OpenAI, ChatGPT will only display canvas windows when it determines that having a separate workspace could be useful—for example, for lengthy outputs or intricate coding jobs. To open a project window automatically, you may alternatively just write "use canvas."

Levine demonstrated to TechCrunch how the new features of ChatGPT could facilitate email writing. An email generated by ChatGPT can be requested by users, and it will appear in the canvas window. Next, users have the option to change the writing's length by toggling a slider. Additionally, you can highlight particular lines and instruct ChatGPT to add emojis or make changes like "make this sound friendlier." Additionally, users can request that ChatGPT translate the entire email into a different language.

The coding canvas has a few somewhat distinct features. Levine gave ChatGPT instructions to launch a Python API web server, which materialized on the canvas window. ChatGPT allows users to add in-line documentation explaining the code in simple terms by clicking the "add comments" button. Furthermore, you may ask the chatbot to explain anything to you or ask questions about it by highlighting a line of code that ChatGPT produced. Additionally, ChatGPT will gain a new "review code" button that will offer specific revision suggestions for any user-written or automatically generated code in the window for the user to accept, reject, or modify themselves. Should they click "approve," ChatGPT will attempt to resolve the issues on its own.  OpenAI states that it intends to make canvas available to free users as well as it exits beta.`,

      date:'october 4,2024',
      content:`M&M described the response as "unprecedented" and stated that it will gradually notify consumers about the estimated delivery schedules over the course of the following three weeks.
Leading SUV manufacturer Mahindra & Mahindra received 1.76 lakh reservations for its recently released Thar ROXX in less than 60 minutes after the window opened. Delivery will start on October 12, which is Dussehra.

There is discussion over this being the highest first-day booking of any car from the Mahindra Group.

M&M described the response as "unprecedented" and stated that it will gradually notify consumers about the estimated delivery schedules over the course of the following three weeks. The SUV manufacturer stated that reservations for Thar ROXX are still available at all dealerships and on Mahindra's website.
With almost 51,000 SUVs sold in September, M&M reported a 24% YoY increase in SUV sales. At 3,027 units, exports increased by 25% YoY in September as well.

The starting price of the five-door Thar SUV, ROXX, is Rs 12.99 lakh. It comes in both petrol and diesel variants.
The Thar Roxx will be equipped with either a 2.0-litre mStallion turbo petrol engine that provides 160 bhp of maximum power and 330 Nm of torque, or a 2.0-litre mHawk diesel engine that puts out 150 horsepower and 330 Nm. Either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission is attached to each engine.
The Thar ROXX has been built as a mainstream SUV, taking into consideration the wants and requirements of purchasers in the market, rather than as a niche product, according to Rajesh Jejurikar, ED and CEO for the auto and farm company. Even with the three-door model, it has grown to be a significant volume player in its current configuration. Jejurikar has previously stated, "We didn't want to stop at that and we think that we can make this brand bigger."

Initial pricing for the 4x4 versions of the new Thar ROXX from Mahindra & Mahindra ranges from Rs 18.79 lakh to Rs 22.49 lakh (ex-showroom).`,

We think that everyone should have access to resources that support their creativity, regardless of whether they are an aspiring filmmaker seeking to break into Hollywood or a creator who enjoys creating videos for their audience. We are thrilled to present Meta Movie Gen, our ground-breaking generative AI study for media, encompassing picture, video, and audio modalities. Our most recent study shows how to create original films and audio, alter pre-existing videos, and turn your own photo into a personalized video using just basic language inputs. When assessed by humans, Movie Gen performs better on these tasks than comparable models in the market.

This endeavor is a continuation of our extensive and well-established history of disseminating basic AI research to the public. The Make-A-Scene set of models, which allowed for the generation of image, audio, video, and 3D animation, marked the beginning of our first wave of generative AI development. Diffusion models led to a second phase of development with Llama Image foundation models, enabling image modification and higher quality picture and video creation. Our third wave, Movie Gen, combines all of these modalities to provide users of the models even more precise control in a manner that has never been feasible before. As with earlier iterations, we expect these models to facilitate a range of new products that may spur innovation.

These foundation models have a lot of fascinating applications, but it's crucial to remember that generative AI cannot take the place of artists' and animators' labor. We are disseminating this information because we are convinced of the ability of technology to foster new forms of self-expression and to open doors for those who might not otherwise have them. It is our dream that everyone will eventually be able to use Movie Gen to produce high-quality videos and audio and realize their artistic dreams.`,

On the Marina's dunes, a second gentleman in his late thirtys was discovered deceased. 
He was recognized by the police as Dinesh Kumar, and a post-mortem would be conducted on his body at Government Royapettah Hospital. 
Due to dizziness, around 100 patients were hospitalized to the government hospitals near the Marina. Forty-five patients were treated at the Government Royapettah Hospital, 43 at Omandurar Hospital, and seven at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH). 

According to RGGGH Dean E. Therani Rajan, only two patients were admitted; the other patients received outpatient care. One patient was pronounced "dead on arrival" upon arriving at the hospital. The 34-year-old had no known medical conditions, but more details could only be obtained during a post-mortem, according to the Dean. 

Patients' main complaints were of extreme heat, humidity, and giddiness. "We received 43 complaints of giddiness from the same person. Increased temperature impairs the hypothalamus's ability to operate. The same is true for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which impairs key organ function. According to Dr. Therani Rajan, some persons have arrhythmia, or abnormal heartbeats, which can result in cardiac arrest and even death.

long though the audience was well-behaved and under control, thousands of people remained stranded for several hours long after the event ended because the public transportation systems malfunctioned. Many in the throng also expressed dissatisfaction with the government for failing to plan for facilities, particularly clean drinking water, for the sizable gathering.`,

    content:`The RBI had prohibited Paytm Payments Bank from enabling credit transactions in client accounts, including prepaid cards and wallets, or taking deposits.

According to a top company official on Sunday, Paytm's top focus right now is investing in its consumer payments business in an attempt to make up for lost user base as a result of RBI regulatory actions.
The RBI had prohibited Paytm Payments Bank from enabling credit transactions in client accounts, including prepaid cards and wallets, or taking deposits.

In order to concentrate on its primary business of financial services distribution and payment processing, Paytm sold its ticketing division to foodtech company Zomato in August for a sum of Rs 2,048 crore.
"Our major business is still processing payments, and the merchant side is still robust. Regulating restrictions, however, caused us to lose a sizable portion of our consumer base. During an interactive event hosted by the Calcutta Chapter of Young Indians, the youth wing of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma stated, "Going forward, we aim to reinvest in the consumer payments business area."

UPI payments are made by consumers, whereas QR code transactions are made by merchants.
The amount of monthly transactional users (MTU) dropped sharply from 10.4 crore in January to 7.7 crore in May, based on corporate data that is currently accessible. In June, the amount was 7.8 crore.
On the other hand, Paytm witnessed gradual expansion in the merchant segment, as seen by the rise in merchant numbers from 79 lakh during the June 2023 quarter to 109 lakh during the June 2024 quarter.

The company is utilizing the Third-Party Application Provider (TPAP) business model, according to Sharma.

It entails providing consumers with digital payment services through a range of platforms and apps. In order to streamline transactions and offer a user-friendly interface for services like bill payment, UPI payments, and other financial transactions, TPAPs work with banks and other financial institutions.`,

    content:`Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday to discuss a potential trade deal, and the two sides decided to support each other financially with over ₹6,300 crore. This agreement comes as the Maldives faced a foreign exchange crisis.

The two parties unveiled a new vision document for an all-encompassing economic and maritime security partnership, which includes important measures to increase trade, digitization, and financial cooperation as well as strengthen the Maldives' maritime surveillance capabilities through the supply of Indian radar systems and other equipment.

Following their discussions, Modi addressed a joint media conference with Muizzu to state that India is the Maldives' "closest neighbour and steadfast friend" and that it will continue to provide support in a variety of areas, including infrastructure development, defines, and development cooperation. 

The State Bank of India (SBI) has rolled over $100 million in Treasury bills for the Maldives this year. Speaking in Hindi, Modi stated that a currency exchange arrangement worth $400 million and ₹3,000 crore (₹30 billion) had been reached today in response to the Maldives' needs.

Muizzu, who took several measures to bring his nation closer to Beijing and lessen its reliance on New Delhi after winning the "India Out" election campaign last year, acknowledged India as a crucial ally for the development of infrastructure and socioeconomic conditions that "has stood by the Maldives during our times of need." 

"The Maldives will continue to be a true friend, dedicated to our shared vision of peace and development in our countries and our region," he continued.
As per Muizzu, the currency swap arrangement will play a crucial role in mitigating the current foreign exchange problems. Additionally, there was a consensus to "continue to be involved in initiatives that will strengthen the Maldives' economic stability and resilience." He said, not providing any specifics.

The Maldives side raised "a number of other points and requests" related financial aid, which will be looked into by New Delhi, according to Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri during a media conference. 

The results of the two-way meeting signalled a dramatic break from a particularly contentious period in New Delhi and Male's relationship. Ties plunged to an all-time low after Muizzu demanded India evacuate more than 80 Indian military personnel deployed in the archipelago to operate three aircraft and subsequently made moves to enhance defence and military cooperation with Turkey and China.`,

    content:`The W1 hybrid hyper car, was unveiled. Priced at a whopping GBP 2 million each, the cars are already assigned to clients.
Highlights
The W1, McLaren's replacement for the P1, has been revealed. 

399 units only, each costing GBP 2 million. 

driven by an electric motor coupled to a 4.0-liter V8 engine. 

Finally, McLaren Automotive has shown the eagerly anticipated P1 replacement. The British supercar manufacturer's most potent road-going vehicle to date is called the W1. According to McLaren, only 399 of the W1's high-priced, GBP 2 million vehicles will be produced; these vehicles have already been assigned to clients.
The W1 is the replacement for the P1, which was the F1's legendary heir. 

The RWD hyper car’s hybrid engine system combines a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 with an E-module, which is made up of an electric motor and a motor control unit with motorsport roots. The highest power output of any McLaren engine, 915 bhp, is produced by the flat-plane crank V8 alone, which can reach 9,200 rpm. An eight-speed dual-clutch transmission is used to transfer power to the back wheels. The 342 bhp electric motor, according to McLaren, weighs only 20 kg and has a particular output that is directly comparable to Formula 1 electric motors. The overall output is at 1258 horsepower and 1340 Nm of peak torque. 
The W1 can sprint from 0 to 100 kmph in 2.7 seconds, go from 0 to 200 kmph in 5.8 seconds, and go from 0 to 300 kmph in less than 12.7 seconds, with a maximum speed restriction of 350 kmph. 
The W1's design differs greatly from the rest of McLaren's line-up in terms of appearance. Its shape is less curved and more upright than that of the P1, its predecessor. The headlamps on the front end have an aggressive appearance, and there are several air vents to improve aerodynamic efficiency. Anhedral doors that are hinged to the roof and rotate upward are standard on the W1. The enormous rear haunches with air intakes that gather air from the outlets on the front wheel arches are among the other design features. 
The large diffuser and the slender, flowing tail lamps make up the majority of the back end.
The W1 has lightweight upholstery and movable pedals inside. Additional features include a Bowers & Wilkins sound system and an 8-inch touchscreen with Apple Carplay and Android auto compatibility.

The W1's advanced aerodynamic characteristics, which combine to produce a noteworthy 1000 kg of downforce, are another talking point. The pushrod and inboard damper system's lower wishbones have been increased considerably to add to the suspension's aerodynamic efficiency and maintain the car's rear-wheel drive's clean air flow. The ride height is decreased by 37 mm in the front and 17 mm in the back when Race mode is engaged.`,

      title:'Google begins releasing new features for Android phones that prevent theft.',
      date:'october 8,2024',
      content:`According to Google, these features are intended to improve security and protect user information in the event that a phone is stolen.
Announced at the I/O 2024 developer conference in May this year, Google has now begun rolling out its new enhanced theft protection capabilities for Android phones. According to Google, these features are intended to improve security and protect user information in the event that a phone is stolen. Android 10 or later versions of phones will support the three new functionalities.

Three new capabilities to prevent theft are available: Remote Lock, Offline Device Lock, and Theft Detection Lock.
Using Google AI, the Theft Detection Lock feature detects when someone snatches your phone out of your hand and tries to ride, drive, or run away with it. It will be promptly locked down to prevent your information from falling into the wrong hands if a theft motion is detected. 

When a thief attempts to disconnect your phone for an extended length of time, the Offline Device Lock function activates. The feature automatically locks your screen to help protect your data even while your device is off the grid. Android may also identify additional signals that your device may be in the wrong hands. 

The Remote Lock option can be useful if your phone has been stolen. Using just your phone number and a brief security challenge, you will be able to lock the screen of any device. Google writes in a blog post that "this buys you time to recover your account details and access additional helpful options in Find My Device, including sending a full factory reset command to completely wipe the device."
The features are being rolled out globally, albeit gradually. While some users may receive the features later, others may already have them. We checked on two Android phones but couldn’t see them, so it may take some time until the theft protection capabilities reach all Android users.`,

With his passing, former Tata Sons chairman Ratan Tata left an enduring impression on India and the world of business.

A nation that held the visionary industrialist in high regard was rocked by his death on Wednesday night. 

At the age of 86, Tata's legendary legacy changed the face of Indian industry forever by transforming the Tata Group from a reputable Indian conglomerate into a global powerhouse.
Ratan Tata was named chairman emeritus of Tata Sons, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, and Tata Chemicals after he resigned as chairman of Tata Sons in 2012.
Tata was hospitalized to Mumbai's Breach Candy Hospital on Monday for a number of medical examinations. Tata oversaw the company for more than 20 years, from 1991 to 2012. He attempted to calm the public in a statement issued soon after social media allegations of his hospitalization went viral, stating, "There is no cause for concern." I'm still feeling upbeat. However, by Wednesday, the situation had deteriorated to the point where a loss would be felt profoundly throughout India and beyond.
We say goodbye to Mr. Ratan Naval Tata, a remarkable leader whose efforts have influenced the Tata Group and the country, with deep sadness. He served as a friend, mentor, and advisor in addition to being the chairperson. The Tata Group grew internationally under his leadership while staying true to its core values of innovation, excellence, and integrity. Millions were impacted by his commitment to generosity, which had a long-lasting effect on fields including healthcare and education. He will be remembered for his sincere humility in every encounter. In a statement, Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran stated, "We offer our sincere condolences to his loved ones on behalf of the Tata family, and his legacy will continue to inspire us."

      content:`Results for Tata Consultancy Services' Q2 of FY25: Analysts had anticipated that the IT behemoth owned by the Tata group would see strong deal execution support net profit and that the ramp-up of important deals, notably its ongoing relationship with BSNL, would fuel Q2 revenue.
For the second quarter that ended in September, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) reported a 1.1 percent quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) decline in net profit to Rs 11,909 crore, falling short of Street estimates. According to the stock exchange filing, the largest IT service provider in India saw an increase in operational revenue to Rs 64,259 crore in Q2 FY24.

TCS generated revenue of Rs 63,938 crore and a net profit of Rs 12,420 crore during July to September.
Additionally, TCS announced the payment of a Rs. 10 interim dividend per share. The record date to ascertain if stockholders are eligible for the corporate action is set for Friday, October 18, 2024, by the IT bellwether. Previously, on July 19, 2024, the business distributed an interim dividend of Rs 10. 

The company said in a statement that the Energy, Resources, and Utilities sectors drove revenue growth. 

"This quarter, like in the previous several, we observed the cautious patterns holding true. In the midst of an unpredictable geopolitical environment, BFSI, our largest vertical, began to rebound. TCS CEO and Managing Director K Krithivasan stated, "We also observed a significant result in our Growth Markets.

The operating margin for the big IT company in the second quarter decreased to 24.1 percent from 24.7 percent in the previous quarter. There was an 18.5 percent net margin. During the quarter, TCS added a net 5,726 employees. Following a year of decreased recruiting, TCS added about 11,000 colleagues as of H1FY25. 

Analysts had predicted that the ramp-up of significant acquisitions, especially its ongoing relationship with BSNL, would drive the IT giant Tata Group's Q2 revenue. They also predicted that strong deal execution and the company's expansion in North America, BFSI, and retail would support the net profit.
While continental Europe increased by 1.8 percent and the UK grew by 4.6 percent YoY in CC terms, North America continued to slow down by 2.1 percent YoY. 

TCS's total order book was $8.6 billion, representing a 23.2% YoY decrease and a 3.61% sequential gain. TCS closed a number of retail deals this quarter, including, to mention a few, Primark, McDonald's, and Croma. There are presently 600 AI/Gen AI projects being worked on by the business.

      content:`On October 24th, the Core Ultra 200S series—which emphasizes performance per watt and an integrated NPU—will be released.*

The increased heat and power consumption of Intel's desktop CPUs is finally being addressed. Arriving on October 24th, Intel's new flagship Core Ultra 200S family of CPUs is designed to run cooler and more efficiently than its 14th generation counterparts by concentrating on performance per watt. These are also the first enthusiast desktop CPUs from Intel with an integrated neural processing unit, or NPU, to speed up AI activities. These CPUs are codenamed Arrow Lake S.

For aficionados in desktop and mobile, "Arrow Lake will deliver Intel's best performance," says Josh Newman, general manager and vice president of product marketing for client computing. "As well as delivering the first Intel AI PC for enthusiasts in both the desktop and mobile performance space, Arrow Lake is also delivering that performance at significantly lower power levels than previous generations of Intel enthusiast products."
Intel has made significant efforts to lower the power consumption of their chips, which is at the core of the Arrow Lake architecture. The Intel Core CPU versions 13 and 14 were both power-hungry, frequently consuming significantly more power than their AMD counterparts. When doing routine desktop chores, the power consumption will be halved thanks to these new Core Ultra 200S series CPUs. Additionally, Intel promises to save a significant amount of power when gaming.

According to Intel Vice President of Client Computing Group Robert Hallock, "You'll see about half the power consumption at the desktop." Additionally, employing a single core will result in around half the power. 50 to 150 watts will be used for gaming, depending on the title and how it behaves.


In contrast to its current Core i9-14900K, Intel showcased Assassin's Creed Mirage operating on its flagship Core Ultra 9 285K during a recent press briefing. In Mirage, the Ultra 9 285K produced performance that was comparable to or better at 80 watts less, and according to Intel, it can save up to 58 watts of power when playing games like Call of Duty.`,

      content:`Apps like ChatGPT and Midjourney gained popularity thanks to early AI applications like chatbots and picture production. 

Among other things, Google now provides deep AI integrations in its products and the Gemini chatbot assistant for image generation. 

Though it might seem like a disservice to recent Pixel customers, Imagen 3 on Gemini now offers free access to realistic text-to-image models.
Though AI is still developing, only a few early uses have captured the public's attention: chatbot-style conversations and the creation of images in response to textual requests. Just these elements contributed to the meteoric rise in popularity of apps like ChatGPT and Midjourney. 

Google is now among our top AI apps for Android because to its numerous deep AI integrations and Gemini, a chatbot assistant that can also generate images. The corporation has provided a boost to Gemini's image creation capabilities.
After revealing Imagen 3 at I/O earlier this year, Google has been using the technology in the background for Pixel Studio and other apps. Users can instruct the AI to create photos, and after a few repetitions, they can selectively improve the output. The software was restricted to the most recent Pixel 9 series, but it appears to function effectively with photos of individuals. A recent online visit to the Gemini service revealed that Imagen 3 is also accessible through the service, even at the free tier (via NotebookCheck).
For the past few months, Google has been using the AI Test Kitchen to test Imagen 3 on Gemini. We are seeing a pop-up regarding these image generating capabilities on Gemini, which suggests that the firm chose to make them available to all customers after a few months of testing. In contrast to the Pixel Studio program, which transformed your prompt's artistic definitions into drop-down menus with options, Google's Gemini deployment prioritizes image quality, detail, and greater photorealism than the outgoing model.

While the free use of Google's award-winning text-to-image model, which boasts unexpected realism, is undoubtedly beneficial, a considerable portion of Pixel 9 series buyers purchased the device specifically for the Pixel Studio app's ease of use. The phone isn't even a year old yet, and it may seem unfair to Google to make the Imagen 3 so widely available to Pixel customers who paid actual money for the AI intelligence.`,

In addition to the humanoid robots, the electric vehicle manufacturer unveiled Cyber cab, a larger self-driving automobile that can fit up to 20 people, and Cyber cab, a self-driving robo taxi.

In a video demonstration shown at the ceremony, Optimus was also seen performing household chores like picking up deliveries and watering plants. "Among you, the Optimus will stroll. You can approach them directly, and they will offer beverages, 
It may take a further two years for anyone hoping to utilize Tesla's Optimus for factory labor or dog walking, though, since Musk has previously stated that the humanoid robots won't be ready for usage until 2026. Nevertheless, they were far more visible on the Tesla factory floor.

Musk has consistently stated that he sees applications for the humanoid Optimus robots outside of industrial tasks. Musk revealed to the public, for the first time, a bipedal Optimus prototype that could walk on stage and wave to the audience in 2022. The Optimus Gen 2 was seen to be being remotely controlled in a video, raising doubts about the robot's ability to move on its own. 

The demonstration on Thursday demonstrated that Tesla has actually successfully developed autonomous locomotion with Optimus.`,

      date:'october 12,2024',
      content:`I look forward to carrying on the legacy of Mr. Ratan N. Tata and the Founders of the Tata Group," Noel Tata stated in response to his appointment. Established over a century ago, the Tata Trusts represent a distinctive means of pursuing social good.
Among these are the two main trusts, the Sir Ratan Tata Trust and the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, which together control over 50% of Tata Sons, the main holding company and corporation that promotes the Tata brands. Thirteen charitable trusts together own sixty-six percent of Tata Sons.

Tata Trust chairmen have always come from the Parsi community. It has also been revealed that the community wanted someone with a Tata surname to lead these trusts, which made Noel Tata the most obvious candidate. There were rumours circulating prior to his selection that Mehli Mistry, a close confidante of Ratan Tata, was also a contender. However, this could not be verified.

In a joint meeting in Mumbai, the trustees of the several Tata Trusts expressed their condolences for the passing of Ratan Tata, the chairman of the Tata Trusts, and "recalled his yeoman services not only to the Tata Group but also to nation building," according to a statement.

The announcement also stated, "It was unanimously decided in separate meetings held immediately thereafter to appoint Mr. Noel Naval Tata as the Chairman of the various Trusts that constitute the Tata Trusts and also designate him as Chairman, Tata Trusts." 

It further stated that his appointment is effective right now. As the sixth chairman of the Sir Ratan Tata Trust and the eleventh chairman of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, Noel assumed these roles.

"I look forward to carrying on the legacy of Mr. Ratan N. Tata and the Founders of the Tata Group," Noel Tata stated in response to his appointment. The Tata Trusts, which were established over a century ago, offer a special means of pursuing social good.`,

      content:`As a result of this upgrade, HAL is now the 14th Maharatna CPSE, a distinction that will strengthen its financial and operational independence.
With this promotion, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) is now a Maharatna Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE). Following Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's clearance, the Department of Public Enterprises announced the upgrade through a post on X (previously Twitter) on October 12.

Two high-level bodies, led by the Finance Secretary on the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) and the Cabinet Secretary on the Apex Committee, had already recommended HAL's upgrade.

Under the Department of Defence Production (DoDP), HAL reported a net profit of Rs 7,595 crore and annual revenue of Rs. 28,162 crore for the fiscal year 2023–2024. As a result of this upgrade, HAL is now the 14th Maharatna CPSE, a distinction that will strengthen its financial and operational independence. 

The government gave "Maharatna" status to Oil India in August of last year, making it the most recent corporation to do so. 

There are currently 14 "Maharatna" public sector enterprises (PSUs) in India, including the recently renamed Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and well-known companies like BHEL, BPCL, Coal India, GAIL, HPCL, Indian Oil, NTPC, ONGC, Power Grid, SAIL, Oil India, REC, and PFC.

A corporation must meet strict financial requirements in order to be granted Maharatna status: an average annual net value of more than Rs 15,000 crore, an average annual turnover exceeding Rs 25,000 crore, and an average annual net profit of more than Rs 5,000 crore during the previous three years.
PSUs with Maharatna status have more freedom to invest in capital projects, such as replacements or new purchases, without any financial restrictions. These businesses must also run on their own, without reliance on government assurances or budgetary support.

In contrast, corporations having Navratna status can invest up to ₹1,000 crore, or 15% of their net worth, in a single project without obtaining previous government approval. This means that the category confers greater financial and operational freedom.`,

      title:'Verified AI Hack Raises New Gmail Security Alert for 2.5 Billion Users',
      date:'october 13,2024',
      content:`Although Google has put in place progressively more advanced safeguards to prevent hackers from accessing your Gmail account, hackers are also developing AI-driven assaults. Google estimates that over 2.5 billion people utilize the Gmail service at any given time. That it is such a target for hackers and con artists is understandable. What you should know is as follows.

The Most Recent AI-Powered Gmail Attack Is Pretty Awesome

Microsoft solutions consultant Sam Mitrovic has cautioned others after nearly falling for a “super realistic AI scam call” that might fool even the most seasoned users.
It began a week before Mitrovic became aware of how sophisticated the attack was against him. In a blog post alerting other Gmail users to the potential threat, Mitrovic describes, "I received a notification to approve a Gmail account recovery attempt." One well-known technique used in phishing attacks is the request for confirmation of account recovery or password reset, which leads the victim to a phony login page where they are required to provide their login information in order to report the request as not coming from them.

Naturally, Mitrovic was not buying into this and turned off the notification that seemed to be from the United States as well as a missed call that seemed to be from Google in Sydney, Australia, around forty minutes later. Thus far, it seems quite simple and avoidable. Then, almost exactly one week later, the real fun began with another notice request for permission of account recovery, followed forty minutes later by a phone call. This time, Mitrovic didn't miss the call and answered it. An American voice identifying itself as Google assistance verified that the Gmail account had been the subject of questionable behaviour.

After I told him no, he inquired as to whether or not he had logged in from Germany, to which I replied in the negative, Mitrovic added. All of this is intended to instill dread in the recipient and trust in the caller. At this point, the phishing plan took a quick and extremely clever turn for the worst. Mitrovic was notified by the alleged Google support agent that an intruder had gained access to his Gmail account for the previous seven days and had taken possession of account information. Mitrovic remembered the missed call and recovery notification from a week prior, so this raised red flags.

While he was still talking, Mitrovic Googled the phone number he was being contacted from and found that it did, in fact, connect to Google company pages. This alone is a cunning ploy that will probably trick a lot of gullible customers who are caught up in the moment's fear because it wasn't a Google support number; rather, it was about receiving calls from Google Assistant. "You will be informed at the beginning of the conversation that Google is the caller and why they are calling. The reader is kindly informed by the 100% authentic page that "You can expect the call to come from an automated system or, in some cases, a manual operator."`,

He is able to assist. He is a dancer. He's got selfie skills. He is able to speak. He is capable of everything "you want." That robot, Tesla's Optimus, can be a humanoid companion. At Tesla's 'We, Robot' event on Thursday in California, many humanoid Optimus robots were observed pouring beverages to spectators and strolling the ramp.
It can pretty much do anything you ask of it. Perhaps a teacher. It can get groceries, mow your lawn, walk your dog, watch your kids, be your friend, and serve drinks. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, stated, "Anything you can think of, it will work and it's going to be awesome," when unveiling the most recent launch.
A demo film aired during the occasion showed Optimus carrying out home tasks like watering plants, wiping down the kitchen counter, unloading groceries, and engaging in play with kids in addition to picking up deliveries.
Musk demonstrated his claims by bringing several Optimus robots to the gathering and asking guests to treat them kindly. They will serve beverages at the bar, and you can approach them directly. Just having humanoid robots is an amazing experience. They are right in front of you, where you are.
Long term, Optimus will cost between $20,000 and $30,000, according to Musk.

Optimus is astounding the internet.
"Didn't it feel like you were on some time travel trip to be there?" a user said. Undoubtedly, this incident changed history. 

A few users expressed disapproval with Optimus's ability to interact. "Is this really Optimus talking?" a user from X asked. I have the impression that someone is behind it. 
"The ones mingling and serving drinks were remotely operated but still really impressive," another person remarked.

"I'd like to purchase an Optimus once its hand dexterity matches that of a human being. especially if it has the ability to learn and acquire information on a variety of topics. A second person expressed interest in the idea and remarked, "I could use the help working on our rental properties and around our place in Arizona."`,

According to a livestream from Elon Musk's SpaceX Company, the "super heavy booster" had taken off attached to the unmanned Star ship rocket minutes earlier. It then made an impeccable controlled return to the same pad in Texas, where two enormous mechanical "chopsticks" reached out from the launch tower to bring the slowly descending booster to a stop.
Soon later, Star ship’s top stage descended into the Indian Ocean as scheduled, a milestone that was celebrated.

On the fifth test flight of the vehicle, he declared, "Ship landed precisely on target!" "The second of the two goals was accomplished." 

Employees of the corporation cheered as the booster was successfully "caught" at the launch pad in Texas.
On the livestream for the firm, a SpaceX representative remarked, "People, this is a day for the engineering history books." 

Yestraday At 7:25 a.m. (12:25 GMT), the SpaceX facility in southern Texas successfully launched into bright skies.
SpaceX made history in June when it successfully completed its first splashdown with Star ship; a prototype spacecraft that Elon Musk thinks could eventually transport people to Mars. 

In order to increase the likelihood of success, SpaceX says that its engineers have "spent years preparing and months testing for the booster catch attempt, with technicians pouring tens of thousands of hours into building the infrastructure."`,

      date:'october 15,2024',
      content:`Monday night, hours after senior diplomats were ejected from both nations in an intensifying geopolitical spat, Canadian police accused Indian diplomats and consular personnel of engaging in "clandestine" and "criminal" operations within the nation. 


The head of the Royal Canadian Mounted police (RCMP) told reporters during a hurriedly scheduled press conference that the agency has proof of "agents" acting on behalf of the Indian government and engaging in harassment, extortion, intimidation, and coercion. Commissioner Mike Duheme said to reporters that investigations had shown that Indian consular and diplomat personnel stationed in Canada took advantage of their official positions to carry out covert operations like gathering intelligence for the Indian government, either directly or through intermediaries; 

and other people who took voluntary or coercive action.
The Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, accused India last year of assassinating the well-known Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in the British Columbian province. The claims made by the RCMP represent the first official look by the police into the breadth and depth of India's purported activities in Canada.

"We will never tolerate the involvement of a foreign government threatening and killing Canadian citizens on Canadian soil," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declared on Monday night. India erred greatly when it decided to target Canadians with its diplomats and organized crime.

The RCMP has obtained "ample, clear and concrete evidence which identified six individuals as persons of interest in the Nijjar case," according to Canada's foreign minister, Mélanie Joly. 

She claimed that although India was asked to participate with the probe and forgo its diplomatic and consular immunity, it refused. 

Joly stated, "Unfortunately, since India refused to comply and considering the continuous worries about Canadians' safety, Canada served notices of expulsion to these individuals."
Because "getting to the bottom of this is still in the interest of both of our countries," she requested that the Indian government assist the current probe. 
Activists have charged India in recent months with a well-planned campaign of "transnational terrorism" directed on Sikhs.`,

Initially accessible in a limited number of areas, the next-generation health and fitness wearable from the South Korean electronics manufacturer was introduced in July alongside the Galaxy Z 6 series foldable devices. The Galaxy Ring is currently expanding to new markets, one of which being India. Pre-orders for the Galaxy Ring are open till October 15, which may indicate that India will soon be able to buy Samsung's new ring-shaped wearable.

Samsung Galaxy Ring: Specifics of the pre-order

Customers who are interested in buying the Samsung Galaxy Ring can reserve a device on the company's official website in India or through the online retailers Flipkart and Amazon for a nominal fee of Rs 1,999. Samsung has attested to the refundable nature of this token sum.

Customers who pre-reserve a Galaxy Ring will be among the first to purchase the smartphone when it launches, according to Samsung. Furthermore, buyers who pre-reserve a Galaxy Ring from Samsung will receive a Wireless Charger Duo at no additional cost. A charging case and data cord are included with the Galaxy Ring.

Samsung Galaxy Ring: Specifics

The Galaxy Ring will initially be free of charge for users who visit Samsung's website. This suggests that, like Samsung Galaxy Watches, it will connect with the Samsung Health app. This methodology is distinct from certain smart rings provided by other companies, like Oura, which conceal sophisticated health data behind a paywall.
The Samsung Galaxy Ring, which was introduced in July of this year, has a thin design and weighs between 2.3 and 3g, depending on the size. Titanium Black, Titanium Silver, and Titanium Gold are the three color selections and nine size variations for the Galaxy Ring. It has 10ATM water resistance and is constructed of Grade 5 titanium. Up to seven days of battery life between charges is what Samsung boasts. 
Additionally, Samsung has integrated Galaxy AI into the Galaxy Ring to produce comprehensive health reports that highlight different health metrics. The Galaxy Ring with Galaxy AI helps users concentrate on their daily attempts to develop by offering an Energy Score measure that makes recommendations depending on the users' current physical state.

      date:'october 15,2024',
      content:`Adleman, Shamir, and Rivest. These are the people who created the well-known RSA Algorithm.
Chinese researchers have revealed a way to break classic encryption using D-Wave's quantum annealing systems, which could hasten the day when quantum computers actually threaten commonly used cryptography systems. This is a potentially concerning development for global cybersecurity.

The paper, titled "Quantum Annealing Public Key Cryptographic Attack Algorithm Based on D-Wave Advantage," which was published in the Chinese Journal of Computers, described how D-Wave's machines were used to attack symmetric encryption systems and break RSA encryption, raising serious concerns about the future of cybersecurity. 
Under the direction of Shanghai University's Wang Chao, the research team discovered that D-Wave's quantum computers may maximize problem-solving in a way that makes it feasible to breach encryption techniques like RSA.

In the publication, the researchers stated, "We successfully factored a 22-bit RSA integer using the D-Wave Advantage, demonstrating the potential for quantum machines to tackle cryptographic problems."

The work demonstrates how quantum annealing can transform cryptography assaults into more manageable combinatorial optimization issues. 

The researchers stated, "This is the first time that a real quantum computer has posed a substantial threat to multiple full-scale SPN structured algorithms in use today." The SPN structure is the foundation of many popular encryption techniques. 

How does this affect cybersecurity, and why? 
This research has important ramifications. Although this study indicates that the timescale for such threats may be significantly shorter than anticipated, experts have long predicted that quantum computers might someday crack today's encryption. 

"Data security and privacy for a variety of businesses may be gravely jeopardized by the development of quantum computing, impacting basic concepts like confidentiality, integrity, and authentication," Kaur continued. "Revaluating the security of these cryptographic techniques is crucial in light of this." 

The group made the point that information that is encrypted now might be vulnerable if hackers take it with the goal of decrypting it later on when quantum technology develops.`,

      title:`"If Trust Is Lacking...": Jaishankar's Strong SCO Speech in Pakistan Critiques Cross-Border Terrorism`,
      date:'october 16,2024',
      content:`During the SCO meeting in Islamabad on Wednesday, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar sent a strong message to Pakistan over the problem of cross-border terrorism. He suggested that the country should consider the causes behind the deterioration of ties between the two neighbours.

"If trust is lacking or cooperation is inadequate, if the friendship has fallen short and good neighbourliness is missing somewhere, there are surely reasons to introspect and causes to address," Jaishankar stated at the SCO Council of Heads of Government (CHG) summit. The minister went on, "Without specifically addressing Pakistan, 

"It is unlikely that cross-border activities that promote terrorism, extremism, and separatism will also foster parallel developments in trade, energy flows, connectivity, and people-to-people interactions."

In a social media message before leaving Islamabad, he thanked the Pakistani government, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for their kindness and hospitality. 
Relations between Pakistan and India 
Following the Pulwama terror incident in February 2019, India's airplanes struck a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training centre in Balakot, Pakistan, severely straining ties between the two countries. After India stated on August 5, 2019, that it was splitting the state into two union territories and withdrawing Jammu and Kashmir's special powers, the relationship between the two countries further worsened.

Following New Delhi's repeal of Article 370, Pakistan reduced its diplomatic relations with India. India has consistently stated that it wants to have regular neigh borly relations with Pakistan, but it also insists that Islamabad must establish an atmosphere free from hatred and terror in order for these contacts to take place.

Greetings and exchanges 
Jaishankar made his speech the day after he greeted Shehbaz Sharif, the prime minister of Pakistan, shortly after arriving in the country's capital to attend a Shanghai Cooperation Organization conference. The brief conversation happened during a dinner party that Sharif threw for the delegates of the SCO member nations at his house.
After exchanging cordial handshakes, Jaishankar and Sharif had a brief conversation. The prime minister of Pakistan greeted each and every head of the SCO member country delegation. Around 3:30 pm (local time), Jaishankar's plane touched down at the Nur Khan airfield outside of the Pakistani capital, where he was welcomed by high-ranking Pakistani authorities.`,

      title:'According to telecom minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, India will distribute satellite internet spectrum through an administrative process.',
      date:'october 16,2024',
      content:`According to Jyotiraditya Scindia, Union Minister of Communications, India will administratively allot spectrum for satellite communication in accordance with the Telecommunications Act of 2023. This is viewed as a setback for Reliance Jio, which has been advocating for a spectrum auction and a victory for companies like Starlink, owned by Elon Musk, and Kuiper, owned by Amazon.

"Spectrum will be distributed administratively for satcom. that does not imply that spectrum is free of charge. During a press conference at the India Mobile Congress, Scindia stated, "The TRAI will determine what that cost is and what the formula of that costing is going to be."

All around the world, satellite spectrum is distributed administratively. Thus, India is acting in the same manner as the rest of the world. On the other hand, if you do want to put it up for auction, you will be taking a unique approach to doing things. Spectrum used for satellites is shared spectrum. "How can you price spectrum individually if it's shared?" he said.

The ups and downs in the industry have created a high-profile rivalry between well-funded competitors, placing Reliance Jio up against companies like Elon Musk's Starlink.

Reliance Jio had written to the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) earlier this month, objecting to the idea of allocating satellite spectrum administratively and advocating for an auction procedure. But in reaction to the advancement,

"That would be unprecedented," Musk stated, "as this spectrum was long designated as shared spectrum for satellites by the ITU."
On Tuesday, Sunil Bharti Mittal, the chairwoman of Bharti Enterprises, which holds a majority investment in OneWeb, stated that businesses wishing to provide satellite services to retail customers and in metropolitan areas must purchase spectrum and adhere to the same rules.


"And those satellite businesses that wish to operate in cities and cater to individual consumers only have to pay the standard telecom license fees." They are subject to the same rules. They have the same requirements as telecom firms, including purchasing spectrum, paying license fees, and securing networks. of the telecom companies,” Mittal said.`,
